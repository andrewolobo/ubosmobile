The sea itself offers recreational opportunities including boating, camping, off-roading, hiking, use of personal watercraft, photography and bird watching. The sea has been termed a "crown jewel of avian biodiversity," being a major resting stop on the Pacific Flyway, a migratory path for birds. 2 Days Adrift the Salton Sea includes two nights accommodations at the Bombay Beach Inn, boat rental at the Salton City Harbor, and a guided fishing tour.</description>
